# Yoourlink Api


## Development

### Quick start for code developers
Prerequisites:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)

> Meteor automatically installs a hidden [NodeJS v8](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.16.2/), and [MongoDB v3.6](https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-3.6) to be used when you run your app in development mode using the `meteor` command.

Now just clone and start the app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yoourlink/ui.git yoourlink-ui
cd yoourlink-ui
meteor npm install
meteor
```

To debug the server part, use [meteor debugging](https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteordebug). You should use Chrome for best debugging experience:

```sh
meteor debug
```
You'll find a nodejs icon in the developer console.

## License

Yoourlink is released under the very permissive [MIT license](LICENSE), and made
with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).
